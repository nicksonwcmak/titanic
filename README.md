# Titanic

A project analyzing the Titanic dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). This dataset contains data about passengers of the RMS Titanic and is an introductory dataset used by Kaggle to introduce new users to its website.

I intend to fit both an explanatory model using R, and a predictive model using Python.
